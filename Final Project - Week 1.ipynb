In the real world, it happens frequently that people drive to another city for work or to visit some friends. It is rainy and windy, and on the way, people come across a terrible traffic jam on the other side of the highway. Long lines of cars barely moving. Police cars start appearing from afar shutting down the highway while you are driving. In an effort to reduce the frequency of car collisions in a community, an algorithm must be developed to predict the severity of an accident given the current weather, road and visibility conditions. When conditions are bad, this model will alert drivers to remind them to be more careful.\n\n"
